    <em>My Notes</em>
<br>
<b>THE WEB</b>
<br>
<p>
  The web is the communication between servers, the internet and your computer.
  <br> The computer sends a request to the internet and from the internet to the servers in the form of HTML.
  <br> Then information is transfered back to the internet and subsequently to your computer.
  <br>
</p>
<b>HTML</b>
<br>
<p>HTML - Hypertext Markup Language.
  <br> HTML is the protocal to talk to the servers.
  <br> HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web.
  <br>
  <ul> HTML is made up of:
    <li>Text content
      <li>Markups - code that alter the arrangement and visuals
        <li>References to other documents, videos, pictures etc.
  </ul>
</p>
<b>TAGS</b>
<br>
<p>
  Tags- part of the code in a markup. It is included in what is known as the element.
  <br> Element and Tag are slightly interchangeable.
  <br> The element is the complete code for the markup.
  <br> Tags are written with a beginning tag and an ending tag both surrounded by "
  <>".
    <br> Some tags are void tags which means they don't need an ending.
    <br> Last but not least there are too many tags to memorize so prgrammer look stuff up!

    <ul> Some examples of tags are:
      <li>inserting an image <img src="https://jayfan.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/happy_kitty.jpg" atl="happy cat" height="100" width="100">
        <li>or a link <a href="http://images.clipartpanda.com/halloween-ghost-border-clipart-ghost-clip-art.jpg">
  "hidden in text"</a>.
    </ul>
</p>
<b>STUPID COMPUTERS</b>
<br>
<p>
  Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally.
</p>
<b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
<br>
<p>HTML elements are either inline or block.
  <br> Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them whereas inline does not.
